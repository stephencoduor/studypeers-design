				<h4>What is Studypeers?</h4>
				<p class="mb-25 text-left">Our Team behind the making of Studypeers saw an opportunity for one centralized application to coordinate communication and study tools all in one Application.  We understand how complicated college is and want to bring simplicity to the abundance of apps available to the average college student. All of our colleagues had the struggle of transitioning from highschool to college and from college to universities of the simple fact there were so many steps to apply or transfer or adapt or even to make friends. Our objective was that Studypeers faces all of your troubles that you may face at your College or University and help you to your best ability. Studypeers want to bring virtual interaction to physical interaction and help create study groups and see teamwork as well to build friendships and success. We believe education should be equal for everyone no matter the situation. </p>

						<h3>Our Story</h3>
						<p>Studypeers was created by the need for a better educational platform that relates to our modern society. While taking online courses myself I felt I was excluded from the traditional college experience. I found it hard to adapt to my courses and even harder to socialize with my other peers. I knew there should be a better place to interact with other students and get my assignments done. That’s when the idea of studypeers came in my mind. A place where you can connect with other students in a proactive environment where you can actually accomplish your college needs. An all-in-one platform where everything is synchronized from my class notes to social events throughout campus. A place where I can actually get my work done efficiently and study better. I believe Studypeers has the necessary tools to help students who either struggle with resources or to help them better connect and network with others and help them grow into their career. </p>
